to develop an AI-powered system to detect cyberbullying and analyze trending topics on Twitter.
In my major project, I developed an AI-powered system for detecting cyberbullying and analyzing trending topics on Twitter. Using Selenium WebDriver, I automated real-time data collection, and with a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, I accurately classified tweets as neutral, hate speech, or cyberbullying. Additionally, sentiment analysis (VADER) and topic modeling (LDA) provided deeper insights into online discourse. The results were visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, offering real-time tracking for researchers and policymakers to combat online harassment effectively.
