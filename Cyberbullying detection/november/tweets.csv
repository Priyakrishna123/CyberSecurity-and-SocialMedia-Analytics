"You’re such a loser, no one likes you, just give up already."
Can't believe you still think anyone cares about what you post. Pathetic!
Those people don’t belong here. Keep them out!
People like you ruin everything. Stay away from us!
Your work is garbage. I don’t know how you still have a job.
What a complete joke! This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
"You're doing amazing, don't let the negativity get to you!"
Keep up the great work! So proud of everything you've achieved.
You're not alone. Reach out if you need someone to talk to!
"Went for a walk today, the weather was nice, and I felt great."
Just finished reading a great book; highly recommend it!
Finally got around to organizing my workspace. Feeling productive!
"You people are always causing trouble, it’s all your fault."
That's the most ridiculous comment I've read today. Do you even think before posting?
Everyone knows you’re a failure; why don’t you just stop?
